#  Phonology vs. phonetics

##  Phonology

Phonological theory starts with [@trubetzkoy39]:

* relation of phonology to other studies
* the nature of phonemes
* how to determine the phonemes of a language
* ...
* phoneme neutralization
* ...

##  Phonological theories

* Kazan School (Jan Baudouin de Courtenay, N. S. Trubetzkoy);
* Prague linguistic circle (R. Jakobson, N. S. Trubetzkoy);
* American Descriptivism (L. Bloomfield);
* Feature theory [@jacobson52];
* Generative phonology [@halle62; @halle64; @chomsky64; @chomsky65];
* Natural phonology [@stampe69];
* Autosegmental phonology [@goldsmith76];
* Metrical phonology [@liberman75];
* Atomic phonology [@dinnsen80];
* Government Phonology [kaye85];
* Feature Geometry [@clements85];
* Lexical phonology [@mohanan86];
* Harmonic phonology [@legendre90];
* Element theory [@harris95];
* Optimality Theory [@prince93];
* ... \pause it is just the end of the slide not theories...

##  Phonological research

* classification of phonological units
    * segments
    * features
    * syllables
    * stress
    * tone
    * foot
    * phonological words
* geographical distribution of phonological units, see [WALS](https://wals.info/feature/6A#2/19.3/152.9)
* statistical distribution of phonological units
* universals, see [Konstanz Universals Archive](https://typo.uni-konstanz.de/rara/)
* phonological alternations (historical and sinchronic)
* phonologization

##  Databases of phonological inventories

* [LAPSyD](https://lapsyd.huma-num.fr/lapsyd/) [@maddieson13];
* [PHOIBLE](https://phoible.org/languages) [@phoible19];
* [The database of Eurasian phonological inventories](https://eurphon.info/) [@nikolaev18];
  
##  Phonology of Sign Languages

* Sign Languages are languages! [@stokoe60]
* articulatory features:
    * orientation of the hand;
    * handshape;
    * movement;
    * non-manual components;
* handedness
* signs vs spelling

# Phonetics?

## Phonetics?
![](images/01-Phonetics-vs-Phonology.png)

Phonetics is generally assumed to be a subfield that deals with
**articulatory**, **acoustic** and **perceptional** aspects of phonological units.
Phonology and phonetics together are supposed to describe organization
of sounds in languages.

## Articulatory phonetics

* air stream mechanisms

|           | egressive          | ingressive |
|-----------|--------------------|------------|
| pulmonic  | majority of sounds | rare       |
| glottalic | ejectives          | implosives |
| velaric   |                    | clicks     |

* larynx and vocal cords: phonation types
    * modal voice
    * creacky voice
    * breathy voice

* articulation

## Articulatory phonetics research

* X-ray
* electropalatography
* endoscopy
* ultrasound
* magnetic resonance imaging
* ... and others

## Acoustic phonetics

Acoustic phonetics is the study of the acoustic characteristics of speech:

* frequency, 
* intensity,
* duration.

## Perceptional phonetics

Acoustic signal is not ears.

* Our perceptual systems are tuned by linguistic experience
* Phoneme restoration

Perceptional phonetics research: experiments!
